  <p>My name is Andrew, and I'm a graduate student at the University of Texas at Dallas, an emacs enthusiast, a quiet extrovert, and as of recently, a husband. I love mountain biking, but I've never lived in a place that actually has mountains.</p>
  <p>I've held professional roles in web/back-end development and firmware development for microcontrollers. Firmware I've written has communicated with satellites and driven devices that monitor water wells in Africa.</p>
  <p>My research is predominantly in graph theory with a focus on surface embedded graphs. If you're interested in that sort of thing, you might like my <a href="https://www.carpequeso.com">other blog</a> that's tailored more towards computer science theory and maths.</p>
