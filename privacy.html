I am not convinced that it is ethical to track visitors to this site. While my readers (who are likely more "tech-savvy" than average) may understand the extent of data collection on the modern web well enough to make an informed decision, the average user does not. I expect the average user will always perceive blog articles like these (or other similar kinds of static content) in much the same way that they perceive a book or newspaper&#x2014;without any expectation that the author is watching from behind one-way glass.

Therefore, I will <b>never track you in any way</b>. This means that I am relying on you to <a href="file:///contact">get in touch</a> if you have feedback on what you see and read here. I can't A/B test or track engagement, so we must actually have a conversation for me to find out what you think. Some might see this as a disadvantage, and in a sense, it is. However, it feels like a way to inject a bit of humanity back into a very strange and inhuman modern internet. Nothing will be done without your express consent.

<p>
If ever you find a tracking script on this site, please don't attribute to malice what can be better explained by ignorance. I might have added a tool or extension to the site that had unintended consequences. <a href="file:///contact">Let me know</a>, and I will find a way to remove it.

I reserve the right to advertise on this site if I so choose, but if I do, I will only do so in a way that does not track you.
