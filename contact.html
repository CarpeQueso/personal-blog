If you would like to get in touch, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:contact@j.andrewcrain.com">contact@j.andrewcrain.com</a>. If you prefer conversations to be both public and brief, <a href="https://twitter.com/j_andrewcrain">twitter</a> is also an option.

Since this website doesn't contain any kind of tracking or analytics tools, the feedback I receive has to come from a person who is specifically interested in giving it. I always appreciate when anyone takes the time to reach out.
